Description: The Salesforce JARM Tool <https://github.com/salesforce/jarm> is an 
    active Transport Layer Security (TLS) server fingerprinting tool. JARM 
    fingerprints can be used to quickly verify that all servers in a group have 
    the same TLS configuration; group disparate servers on the internet by configuration, 
    identifying that a server may belong to Google vs. Salesforce vs. Apple, for example; 
    Identify default applications or infrastructure; and/or Identify malware command and 
    control infrastructure and other malicious servers on the Internet. Tools
    are provided to generate JARM fingerprints.
